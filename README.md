  ## Description 
  Live site - [Employee Directory](https://jk-employee-directory.herokuapp.com/)

  Learning react is huge! The power of the virtual DOM, compoenents, properties, and state all make development a breeze...once you get the hang of it. This employee directory is a step in that direction. Using the random person api we can get a mock dataset. Using state and componenets we are able to render this assortment of 'empoloyees' to the page.
